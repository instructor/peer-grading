# peer-grading
In group work, ideally all team members contribute equally to the overall success of the project, but usually in individually different ways. "Peer grading" is used to assess individual contributions in group work. In this process, each group member evaluates all other group members (external evaluation) as well as himself (self-assessment) according to definable criteria. The results are made available anonymously within each team. The result of a mutual evaluation on the basis of various criteria allows a differentiated assessment of the self-assessment and the assessment by others as well as the own positioning within the group. Peer grading thus enables a reflective view of one's own contribution. Here, a flexible configurable online tool is presented, which is used to conduct peer grading campaigns in the context of the Business Case Studies Module (BCS) in the Department Business at BFH.
